At first the algorithm generates chests in different difficulty zones (Early and Late);

There are different loot tables for the difficulty zones.

Once the chests are generated, we select an Early chest at random give it a key for the door and affect it to the door.

This ensures feasibility of the level. We will do the same with the end door but this time we can choose a chest in the Early and Late difficulty zones.

Then for the rest of the chests we give out random items, only the keys have a drop rate.

Then for each chest with a key : if it's a door key, we affect it to the door 
                                 if it's a end door key we affect it to the end door
                                 if it's a regular key we affect it to a random chest of the same difficulty or above 

The final step is to run the loop checker to recursively check if there are anny game breaking loops and break them

After this setup we run the solver, it goes from the end door and recursively looks at what each chest and door needs to be opened until it stops, 
when this is finished we can now determine the path to take to finish the level
